blueMSX-Core
============

blueMSX-Core is an experimental [blueMSX] [1] core plugin for [OpenEmu] [2]. It's in a preliminary state.

What works
----------

* Video
* Sound
* Basic cartridge emulation

What sort of works
------------------

* Input - it's incomplete. Only joystick devices are supported
* Stability - the emulator isn't very stable

What doesn't work
-----------------

* Disks
* Cassette tapes
* Non-C-BIOS systems
* Lots of other stuff
